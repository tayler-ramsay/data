                <p>On a hot July morning, Ray Hernandez made his way across town. With a water bottle in one hand, electric wheelchair controls in the other, he was bound for the WellSpan Community Health Center in York. This trip would be a feat for Hernandez, who was once homebound, but he had support — from WellSpan’s Bridges to Health program.</p>
                <p>With loved ones and members of his care team from Bridges to Health by his side, Hernandez embarked on the long trek from his home to the Health Center.</p>
                <p>As he arrived at his destination, he was greeted by cheers from friends and caregivers. And, as it happened to also be Hernandez’s 60th birthday, the group threw him a surprise party in his honor — complete with a birthday cake.</p>
                <p>Hernandez, fighting back tears, noted that it was just the second time in his life that he had received a birthday cake. “I’ve been through a lot of sorrow,” he said.</p>
                <p>Left paralyzed during a carjacking several years ago, Hernandez saw his health decline over the years, requiring more health care services. That’s when his care team approached him about the Bridges to Health program, which assists patients like Hernandez with complex health and social needs.</p>

                <p class="smaller-text">Above: <span class="semibold">Ray Hernandez</span> of York, a participant of WellSpan's Bridges to Health program.</p>
                <p>“Some of the patients we care for have such extraordinary challenges with overwhelming medical complexities, and are consuming so many health care services. We need to provide a better way for them to receive the care they need,” said Chris Echterling, M.D., WellSpan’s medical director for vulnerable populations and the Bridges to Health program.</p>
                <p>The program has been successful, with patients seeing about a 30 percent reduction in both emergency department visits and inpatient hospital stays, making these resources available to other community members.</p>
                <p>To further provide the right care, in the right environment, the team at Bridges has launched a pilot program, with two local recuperative care facilities for patients who no longer require hospital care but who may not be able to return home.</p>
                <p>One such program is WellSpan’s partnership with York County’s Pleasant Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where WellSpan York Hospital transitions patients to appropriate care after they no longer need the services of an acute care hospital.</p>
                <p>“It’s another example of us working to get patients the right care, in the right location, regardless of the ability to pay,” said Dr. Echterling.</p>
                <p>It’s a caring, personalized approach that, Hernandez says, is worth celebrating.</p>
                <p>“It all means a lot to me,” he said.</p>
